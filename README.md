# Search Roulette

_a search engine that randomly redirects to a different search engine_

- privacy friendly search engines by default (DuckDuckGo, Startpage, MetaGer...)
- spreading searches across many engines potentially limits the data they _could_ collect
- no tracking: search query never reaches our server (stays in `hash` of URL before redirection)
- supports some !bangs
- public domain, do whatever you want with this source code
