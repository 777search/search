        <h2>What's this?</h2>
        <p>
            This is a search engine that redirects your search to a random search engine.<br>
            This limits what each search engine could learn about you.<br>
            At the very least, this lets you experience different search engines!<br>
            Currently,
            <script>document.write(engines.length)</script> different search engines are included.
        </p>

        <h3>This server does not see your search queries!</h3>
        <p>
            When added as default search engine,<br>
            the search query is placed in the URLs <code>hash</code>, which
            the server does not see, but the local JavaScript does.<br>
            This site's JavaScript just reads it and builds a link to another search engine.<br>
            This means this server literally does not even see your searches!<br>
            The search engine you're redirected to can see them, obviously.
        </p>

        <h3>!bangs</h3>
        <p>You can use DuckDuckGo style !bangs here.
        </p>

        <h3>Add this as your default search engine</h3>
        <p>
            In Firefox, you can click the URL bar and at the bottom add "Search Roulette", then select it as default
            in the settings.<br>
            In other browsers, use <code>https://777search.github.io/search/#q=%s</code>.
        </p>

        <h3>Customizable</h3>
        <p>
            You can edit the list of search engines. Don't like swisscows? Remove it. You'd like to use 10 different
            SearXNG instances? Do it!
        </p>

        <h3>Public Domain</h3>
        <p>
            Check out the <a href="https://github.com/777search/search">GitHub repo</a>!<br>
            You can easily use a local copy with a <code>file://</code> URL or host your own fork.
