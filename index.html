            <h2>What's this?</h2>
            <p>
                This is a search engine that redirects your search to a random search engine.<br>
                This limits what each search engine could learn about you.<br>
                At the very least, this lets you experience different search engines!<br>
            </p>

            <p>DuckDuckGo's famous !bangs partly work here.</p>

            <h3>We do not see your search queries!</h3>
            <p>
                The search query is only ever saved in the URLs <code>hash</code> which the server does not see, but the
                Browser does.<br>
                This site's JavaScript just reads it and builds a link to another search engine.<br>
                This means we literally do not even see your searches!
